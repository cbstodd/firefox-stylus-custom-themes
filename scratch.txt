This week, Page McConnell shares a favorite summer recipe from home: Chicken on a Stick, a basil vinaigrette, a side of roasted mushrooms and a vegan Alfredo sauce for pasta. We’re also sharing a simple dessert from our friends at Ben & Jerry’s: an Ice Cream Sandwich.

A note from Page:

I resisted the urge to submit a recipe for Cornish game hen, and opted for one of our favorites, Chicken on a Stick. ￼

This recipe is nice because it can be prepared ahead of time, served hot or cold, it’s great for reheating, and something that even kids seem to enjoy. The basil dressing ￼￼￼is refreshing, tastes great on everything and should not be used sparingly. For a vegan option we’ve included an Alfredo sauce, over a pasta of your choice. The mushrooms are a nice side. All of these dishes play well together.

I’m happy to say that Ben and Jerry’s has contributed a recipe for an ice cream sandwich for dessert. At this point you probably already know how I feel about sandwiches￼.

Chicken On A Stick

Ingredients
1-2 lbs, skinned, boneless chicken cut into 1 1⁄2 inch cubes 1⁄4 cup avocado oil
2 tbsp lime juice
2 tsp minced garlic
1 tsp salt
1⁄2 tsp ground pepper
Wooden skewers

Instructions
If using wooden skewers, soak in cold water for at least 30 minutes before grilling.
In a large bowl, combine avocado oil, lime juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Add chicken and toss to coat, then marinate and chill for at least 30 minutes.

Heat grill to medium and cook skewered chicken for about 10-12 minutes total, allowing all four sides to get nice even grill marks.

1⁄2 tsp salt
1 small garlic clove

Roasted Mushrooms

Ingredients
2 cups shiitake mushrooms sliced
2 small shallots thinly sliced
4 garlic cloves thinly sliced
1⁄2-1 tbsp avocado oil

Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream Sandwiches
